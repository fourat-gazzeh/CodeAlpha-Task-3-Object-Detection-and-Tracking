# CodeAlpha-Task-3-Object Detection and Tracking

This repository contains a Python script that utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object tracking in a video stream using OpenCV. The script reads a video file, detects and tracks objects, and displays the results in a dynamically resized window.

## Features

- **YOLOv8 Model**: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model for object detection and tracking.
- **Video Processing**: Reads and processes video frames in real-time.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Resizes the output window to fit the screen for better visualization.
- **Object Tracking**: Detects and tracks objects in each frame of the video.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLO

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/yolo-object-tracking.git
   cd yolo-object-tracking
